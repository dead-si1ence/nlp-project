To train the model: Optimize value of parameters to minimize loss
31
To train a model, we gradually adjust parameters to minimize a loss
• Recall: 𝜃 represents all the
model parameters, in one
long vector
• In our case, with
d-dimensional vectors and
V-many words, we have →
• Remember: every word has
two vectors
• We optimize these parameters by walking down the gradient (see right figure)
• We compute all vector gradients!
if there are a 100 dimensional word representation, then they're sort of a 100 parameters of aardvark and context, etc
